# Mini-Interpreter
There are two major phases to this project:
Phase1: 1) Provide a Linked List and Stack implementation. 
2) Use these data structures to implement a basic interpreter for a very small subset of the Java Byte Code language.
Phase2: 1) Provide a Hash Map implementation.
2) Use the implemented data structures to extend your basic interpreter to support a larger subset of the Java Byte Code language
